##Project: Analyze Terrorism patterns in the United States
Purpose: Data Mining and Database Managment Course project - George Mason University
Date: May, 2016

Abstract: This project evaluates the impact and outcome of terrorist acts on United States soil by foreign-born immigrants and U.S. born citizens. The attached paper will illustrate how machine learning and data mining approach were utilized to identifying key attributes of a population that may be terrorism-prone. To acquire the necessary data, the research team performed extensive data wrangling to accumulate a comprehensive dataset of US terrorism incidents that identified the individuals involved and their immigration status. This allowed the construction of statistical models that identify the key attributes. This constructed dataset also provides a new possibility to examine the problem of terrorism with a systematic approach based on a feature vector and some target variables (i.e., Number of terror incidents, Number Killed, Number Wounded). The team finds that from 2000-2015 the Foreign-Born population did not commit any acts of terror. The only exception is immigrants who are born or convert to Islam. From the perspective of terrorism -90% of the immigrants do not pose a problem. This paper is the first component of research, as we realize much more needs to be understood in order to determine any prescriptive analytics. The paper will cover performance of the following three models and the results: Multi Linear Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, and Neural Network prediction with Boosting. 

Data Visualization: Data was prepared with Frontline XLMiner and Tableau (published to Tableau Public- https://public.tableau.com/profile/anya7088#!/vizhome/TerrorismSuccesspostSeptember112001/Dashboard1

This project is in phase 2, where we hope to drill down more thoroughly on motive, immigration status, and key indicators of success. The most challenging item for this project is ecological fallacy and leakage on some variable vectors.
